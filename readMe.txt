Taking input form input.txt :

i have given test case that is mentioned on assignment in inputfile.txt

from there im going to read all the charecters  line by line by using  loop
in the same loop im converting charecter of each line to integer and adding them to array v.

I also initialized hash map m , to store the keys that  are already in the array v. 

Now  im taking 2 for loops 

for i=0 to n 
	for j=i+1 to N

here im checking the difference of 2 elements for the array v which is v[j]-v[i], 

the out next condition is :

 if difference of v[j]-v[i] is present in m which is the hasp map and diffence != one of the elements in (index of v[j] and v[i]):
	
	if the conditions comes true we print difference of (v[j]-v[i]) and v[j] ,v[i])


TO run the code 

my input file name is : input.txt

my input file name is : outfile.text

c++ file: assignment.cpp

command line to run:

1. make
2. ./assignment input.txt outfile.txt
3. vi
